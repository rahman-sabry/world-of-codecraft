# World of Codecraft

A high-fantasy MMO village for Herdr. One big terminal sits in a carved oak and gold
frame. Below it, Valbrume, an isometric pixel-art village, shows every coding agent as
a hero of a race and a class, working at its building. The top bar is a strategy-game
resource bar, spaces are heraldic districts on the left, and day turns to night with
the clock. The art is original: it imitates no existing game.

## What you see

- **Top bar** (48 px, window drag, traffic lights at 16,23). A carved beam with:
  - the crest and the logo "WORLD OF CODECRAFT" in Cinzel Decorative, with
    "village of Valbrume" under it;
  - resource plaques, each an icon, a value and a caption: Gold (Claude account A),
    Wood (account B), Heroes ("1/2", heroes at work out of all heroes) and Fair (time
    until the weekly quota reset);
  - a parchment scroll in the middle with the shown district and quest;
  - on the right, an alert when a hero waits, then the sun or the moon, the canonical
    hour (Matins, Lauds, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, Compline) and the clock.

  Gold, Wood and Fair are optional and hidden when there is no quota data.
- **Left column** (262 px, iron-framed panel). The "Districts" heading with a session
  count. Then one card per space:
  - a cloth banner with a gold charge, picked by hashing the space;
  - `I · name`, the session and hero counts, and a medallion with the quest count;
  - status chips ("on a quest", "resting", "need help", "to turn in");
  - one row per tab with the hero portrait. The shown tab is highlighted.

  The card frame turns gold when the space is shown and ruby when a hero needs you.
  At the bottom are "+ Quest" (new tab) and "+ District" (new space) buttons.
- **Terminal** (centre). The tab block sits inside four `rail` blocks (14 px gilded
  moulding). Panes use JetBrains Mono on dark oak `#1a1411`, theme
  `World-of-Codecraft`; the text size is left to Herdr's settings. Each pane header (30 px) is an oak plank with rivets and holds:
  - the hero portrait;
  - "Name, Race class", the program and a state gem with its label;
  - the tab title and folder;
  - iron buttons: split right, split down, zoom and close.
- **Village** (bottom, 400 px). On the left, a command panel:
  - "Map of Valbrume": a minimap with unit dots and the camera frame;
  - "Selected unit": the focused agent as a full-length portrait card with name, class
    and race, program, state and quest, plus Go and Next buttons.

  On the right, the world: 5000×400 logical px (x from -1000 to 4000; the village is 0 to 3000)
  with art pixels at 2×, panning horizontally. It contains:
  - buildings: town hall with belfry, mage tower (round, violet cone), forge workshop,
    barracks, Temple of Dawn, tavern, barn with fenced fields, market stalls, a well
    and a notice board;
  - a campfire, a road, a river and a forest;
  - west of the village, farmland: fields with fences and a windmill; east, a lake on the river with a
    jetty and a rowboat;
  - in the top-left corner, a chronicle of the last 4 events on dark tags.

## How it behaves

- **Class comes from the program:**
  - Claude Code: Mage, at the Mage Tower
  - Codex: Artificer, at the Forge Workshop
  - Gemini: Priest, at the Temple of Dawn
  - OpenCode, pi, amp, cursor: Ranger, at the barn and fields
  - any other agent: Rogue, at the market
  - plain shells: Warriors on guard at the barracks
- **Race and name** come from a hash of the terminal address. The races are Elf, Orc,
  Human, Undead and Dwarf.
- **States:**
  - **working**: the hero plays its `work` animation at its building.
  - **idle**: it sits by the campfire (`rest`).
  - **blocked**: `idle` with a red ring, a flashing `!` and a speech bubble.
  - **done**: `idle` with a gold ring, a `?` and sparkles.
- **Movement:** when its spot changes, a hero walks there. Close spots are reached in
  a straight line. Farther ones follow the road, with a 4-direction walk animation.
  Each road leg is a native `left`/`top` transition.
- **Selection:** the selected unit is the focused agent. It gets a green ring and a
  health bar, and the camera glides to it (and follows it while it walks).
- **Camera:** click and drag the village to pan (the camera follows the pointer with no
  glide while dragging), or use the scroll wheel or a minimap click. Any manual pan stops
  the follow until another unit is selected. Units and buttons stop the press, so their
  clicks still work.
- **Clicks:**
  - a unit: `agent.focus` (`pane.focus` for shells)
  - double-click the tower, the forge or the barracks: recruit with `tab.new` (claude,
    codex or a shell)
  - a district card: `space.select`
  - a tab row: `tab.select`
  - a chronicle line: focus that hero
  - the top alert: focus the first hero who is waiting
- **Day and night:** night tiles crossfade over day tiles (opacity 1 at night, 0.55 at
  dawn and dusk). Window and campfire glows pulse, and chimneys smoke.
- **Chronicle:** it logs arrivals, departures and state changes ("[Mage Tower] Gromdal,
  Dwarf mage (Claude Code) sets out on a quest"). It is kept in the store key
  `wocc.chronicle`.
- **Language:** French or English, detected once per start (see `i18n.js`): `WOCC_LANG`
  if set, else macOS `AppleLanguages`, else `LC_ALL` / `LC_MESSAGES` / `LANG`; French when
  it starts with `fr`. Shared with every copy of the mod through the store key `wocc.lang`.
  A block's `props.lang` (`"fr"` / `"en"`) forces it.
- **Keys** (`layout:World-of-Codecraft`): ctrl-shift-i switches the immersive mode
  (`world-of-codecraft.mode`), ctrl-shift-j toggles the bottom village, and ctrl-shift-b
  toggles the left column (`gauche`).

## Activity scenes and village life

- **What a hero is doing**, not just its state: while Herdr says `working`, the hero plays
  a scene read from `~/.local/state/world-of-codecraft/<terminal address>.json`, written by
  the optional integrations (`integrations/claude-code/wocc-activity.py`, an async Claude
  Code hook; `integrations/opencode/wocc-activity.js`, an OpenCode plugin). Tests, commits
  and pushes are recognised only as real commands (start of line or after `;` `&` `|` `(`),
  with heredoc bodies and quoted strings removed first, so "git push" in a message doesn't count. Fields: `act`,
  `outil`, `coups`, `err` / `errT`, `errTache`, `subs`, `tache`, `essai {ok, t}`,
  `commitT`, `pushT`. Without them heroes keep the plain status behaviour.
  - thinking: `idle` + a "· · ·" bubble;
  - reading / searching / web: walks to a scout spot at the forest edge near its building
    (`LISIERE` in lieux.js), two ravens circling;
  - editing code or running commands: fights a creature drawn per task (mages: imp, wolf, goblin, boar, rust
    golem, spectre; other classes: their district's beasts, `DISTRICT` in activite.js). Each
    successful edit or command is a blow (hit pose + flash), 4 fell it (puff) and the next one comes;
    3+ failed tools in a task bring the forest troll, a boss of 8 blows. A failed tool hits
    the hero (red flash, "Ouch!");
  - running tests: a training dummy beside the hero, struck while they run; the result stays
    5 s: knocked over + "Tests passed!", or "Tests failing";
  - compacting: sits cross-legged (`rest`), sparks orbit, a crystal pulses;
  - git commit: a seal and "Sealed!"; git push: a carrier pigeon flies off east;
  - subagents: one wisp per running subagent.
  - **Anti-zapping:** a scene changes only when asked for 8 s and the current one is 15 s
    old (20 s / 40 s to or from the forest edge); meditation, tests and the end switch at once.
- **Village life** (`ambiance.js`): walkers with pauses on the road (a peasant woman and a
  farmer by day, a merchant when 2+ heroes work, a guard with a lantern at night), hens by the
  barn, the tavern cat, a stag at dawn and dusk, sparrows over the fields, fish leaping in the
  river, a treasury of up to 5 coins (account A's week left, cduo only) and fair pennants the
  day before the weekly reset.
- **« Animations » toggle** under the minimap (store key `wocc.anim`, default on). Off:
  heroes stand on still frames, no walking, no scenes, enemies, village life or smoke, and
  no activity polling (about 10 % of a core instead of 27 % on an M2 Pro).

## Immersive mode

The same layout, other blocks shown: the left column (`gauche`) keeps the board on top and the command
panel below (its own block, role `commande`, 400 px, hidden in Workshop); on the right the village and the
terminal swap places: a second village block (`place-immersion`, weight 1, `props.immersion: true`, no panel
inside, hidden in Workshop) fills the space above, the framed terminal (`arene`) shrinks to 400 px below
(resizable), and the bottom village (`place`) is hidden. The header's « Immersion » / « Atelier » (Workshop)
button and ctrl-shift-i (`world-of-codecraft.mode`, read by the header) run `layout.show` / `layout.hide` /
`layout.resize`: layout clicks, so the mode survives restarts. Only the shown village writes the chronicle;
a hidden one keeps no timers. The layout sets no terminal text size, so Herdr's settings choose it.
- **No zoom: more map, baked by the village's own engine.** The direction A art pipeline (procedural voxel
  models, GI lighting, tiled procedural ground, `compose3` compositor) lives in `tools/village-art/`
  (rebuilt from the session transcripts on 08/11/2026 and verified pixel-identical to the approved bake).
  `tools/bake_lands.py` runs that compositor on a canvas 400 px taller on each side: the ground over 1200
  rows (north paths continued, a lane south of the market, two more fields, the river on its own line), the
  village's objects drawn whole, a forest to the north and oaks, bushes, rocks and fences to the south. The
  village tiles are rewritten from the composite only after checking no building pixel changed by day (at
  night the glow differs by one step on 85 pixels near the north edge); the only change is the forest's soft
  shadows on the top of the village's grass, which makes the seam invisible. About 9 minutes; `CACHE=x.npz`
  reuses the composite.
- **Wider lands:** `tools/bake_wide.py` runs after it and re-bakes everything on a 5000×1200 canvas: bake_lands.py's
  ground and objects (re-run from its source), the ground over 5000 columns with the road, fields, the lake and
  two trails added, and 1000 px of new land on each side (forest, farmland and the windmill west; the lake, the
  jetty and, in the north band, a ruined watchtower east). The world keeps its coordinates (`WORLD.x = -1000`).
  No new sprite touches the old tiles; it checks the village's building pixels by day before rewriting the tiles.
  About 40 seconds (sprite loads are cached); `CACHE=x.npz` reuses the composite.
- **Camera:** horizontal and vertical (drag, two-axis wheel), kept inside the bands; selecting a hero
  brings the village back into view.
- **Panel bridge:** the village publishes its camera and units to the store (`wocc.view`, only when
  they change, at most every 300 ms); the panel's minimap reads it and a click writes `wocc.goto`.

## Built from

- **Layout tree:** a root column made of:
  - `fronton` (block, 48 px);
  - `bourg` (row, 6 px padding and gap), holding:
    - `gauche` (column, 262 px, min 200, max 420): `tableau` (weight 1) and `commande`
      (400 px, hidden outside the immersive mode);
    - `droite` (column): `place-immersion` (weight 1, `props.immersion`, hidden outside the
      immersive mode) and `arene` (weight 1, 400 px in the immersive mode; a column of four
      `rail` blocks around the `main` tab block);
  - `place` (block, 400 px, hidden in the immersive mode).

  The root has `titlebar: none`, background `#120c0e`, `font` JetBrains Mono, `ui_font`
  Alegreya Sans, no `font_size`, and a PNG `preview`. There is one layout file; the
  immersive mode is a set of layout clicks on it.
- **The mod** is `mods/world-of-codecraft`, one mod with roles picked by `props.role`:
  - `fronton.js`: the top bar and the immersive-mode switch
  - `tableau.js`: the districts column
  - `rail`: the gilded moulding
  - `place.js`: the world and the command panel, with `commande.js`
  - `pane.js`: the pane header

  The shared code is:
  - `kit.js`: palette, fonts, hero identity, hours and the optional quota reader;
  - `ui.js`: frames built from 4 corners and cropped edge strips, since Herdr has no
    9-slice;
  - `lieux.js`: unit spots, the road and building hit boxes;
  - `heros-data.js` and `monde-data.js`: animation frame tables and world tiles,
    generated;
  - `activite.js`: the activity scenes; `ambiance.js`: village life;
    `creatures-data.js`: creature and villager sprites, generated;
  - `i18n.js`: every visible string in French and English, and the language detection.
- **Herdr API:**
  - data: `spaces()`, `agents()`, `panes()`, `focused()` and the store;
  - commands: `agent.focus`, `agent.next`, `pane.focus`, `space.select`, `tab.select`,
    `tab.new`, `space.new`, `pane.split`, `pane.zoom` and `pane.close`.
- **Timers:** one shared 100 ms timer runs only while a visible unit animates or walks,
  and stops when its village block (`place` or `place-immersion`) is hidden. The clock ticks every 30 s; the sky and quotas
  update every 60 s.
- **Files read and programs run:** the activity files in `~/.local/state/world-of-codecraft/`
  (if the integrations are installed) and `~/.local/state/claude-duo/quota-{A,B}.json`
  (cduo, if present). Once per start it runs `sh` to read the system language
  (`defaults read -g AppleLanguages`, `$LANG`). No network calls.
- **Repo tooling** (`tools/`, not installed): `install.sh` copies the mod, layout and theme
  into the Herdr home (`--integrations` links the hook and plugin); `sync_creatures.py`,
  `sync_heroes.py`, `bake_world.py`, `bake_lands.py`, `bake_wide.py`, `ui.py` rebuild the art from `tools/sources/`.
- **Art** (`art/`):
  - heroes: 30 race×class sprites with `idle`, `rest`, `work` and 4-way walk frames,
    plus night-graded copies;
  - the baked world: day and night tiles, front cut-outs for depth, the minimap;
  - UI chrome: PNGs at 2×;
  - SVG icons.

  Fonts (OFL, `fonts/`): Cinzel Decorative, Cinzel, Alegreya Sans, Jacquard 24 and
  Jersey 15.

## Watch out

- **Depth:** units sort by their y position. Front cut-outs of buildings are drawn
  again above units standing behind them.
- **Frame swaps:** all frames of the current animation are stacked at opacity 0/1, so
  a swap never loads an image.
- **Breathing:** heroes without frames show the standing sprite with a native 1 px
  breathing loop.
- **Demo (screenshots):** `demo: true` on the `place` block shows only demo heroes with every activity
  scene (`heure: 22` for night, `demo: "marche"` makes them walk); on `tableau`, `commande` and `fronton`
  it shows generic districts, tabs, a selected unit and a chronicle (`demo.js`), so a preview never shows
  anyone's projects. `lang: "en"` forces the language. The preview was taken that way, window 1600×1000.
- **Install real files, not symlinks:** Herdr loads images and hot-reloads mods only from
  real paths inside its home. A symlinked mod shows no images and never reloads.
- **Declare `transition` on every render**, 16 ms while standing: GPUI animates only
  changes made after the transition exists, so adding it with the new target jumps there.
- **Two-frame swaps need both loops:** the top frame `opacity -6 → 7`, the one below
  `7 → -6`, same period, linear, created on the same render (clamped, almost instant).
- **Walkers' depth** comes from where they really are on their leg; the 1 s ambient timer
  redraws when one passes behind or out from behind a front cut-out.
- **Many hot reloads** (dozens) can exhaust the mod's JS heap ("out of memory", then
  "Null"): restart the Herdr window.

## Done when

- `herdr-app check mods/world-of-codecraft` passes and `herdr-app status` shows no
  errors.
- Each agent appears at its class building. Blocked shows `!` and a red ring. Focusing
  another agent glides the camera, and a minimap click moves it.
- Without cduo files, the top bar shows no empty quota plaques.
- With a French system the whole interface is in French, otherwise English.
- The « Immersion » / « Atelier » button swaps the village and the terminal without changing
  layout, and the mode survives a restart. The terminal text size follows Herdr's settings.
- With the Claude Code hook installed, a working Claude hero scouts while reading and
  fights a creature while editing; the « Animations » toggle stops every animation.
